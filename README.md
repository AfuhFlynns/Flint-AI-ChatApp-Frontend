## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the frontend:

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Flint-AI-ChatApp.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
  ```bash
  cd Flint-AI-ChatApp/frontend
  ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
4. Start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

## Running the Application

Once the development server is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:<PORT in the terminal>` to start using the Flint AI ChatApp frontend.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the frontend, run:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
This will generate optimized static files in the `build` directory.

## Additional Resources

For more information on how to use and customize the frontend, refer to the documentation and resources provided in the repository.

## User Authentication and Verification

### Authentication

The Flint AI ChatApp frontend supports user authentication to ensure secure access to the application. The authentication process involves the following steps:

1. **Sign Up**: Users can create a new account by providing their email, username, and password.
2. **Login**: Registered users can log in using their email and password.
3. **Token Management**: Upon successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is issued and stored in the browser's local storage for subsequent authenticated requests.

### Verification

To enhance security, the Flint AI ChatApp includes email verification for new users. The verification process includes:

1. **Email Verification**: After signing up, users receive a verification email with a unique link.
2. **Account Activation**: Users must click the verification link to activate their account and gain full access to the application.

### Implementation Details

#### Sign Up

To sign up, users need to fill out the registration form and submit it. The frontend sends a POST request to the backend API endpoint `/api/auth/signup` with the user's details.

#### Login

For logging in, users enter their credentials in the login form. The frontend sends a POST request to the backend API endpoint `/api/auth/login`. If the credentials are valid, the backend responds with a JWT, which is stored in local storage.

#### Email Verification

After successful registration, the backend sends a verification email to the user. The email contains a link to the verification endpoint `/api/auth/verify?token=<verification_token>`. When the user clicks the link, the backend verifies the token and activates the account.

### Example Code

#### Sign Up Form

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const SignUp = () => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');

  const handleSignUp = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    try {
      await axios.post('/api/auth/signup', { email, username, password });
      alert('Verification email sent. Please check your inbox.');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error during sign up:', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSignUp}>
      <input type="email" value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} placeholder="Email" required />
      <input type="text" value={username} onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)} placeholder="Username" required />
      <input type="password" value={password} onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)} placeholder="Password" required />
      <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default SignUp;
```

#### Login Form

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const Login = () => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');

  const handleLogin = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    try {
      const response = await axios.post('/api/auth/login', { email, password });
      localStorage.setItem('token', response.data.token);
      alert('Login successful');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error during login:', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleLogin}>
      <input type="email" value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} placeholder="Email" required />
      <input type="password" value={password} onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)} placeholder="Password" required />
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default Login;
```
